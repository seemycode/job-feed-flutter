## 1. Requirement

Since this is an exempt of the full app, let's consider just three main requirements below:

> The app should show a list of job boards that the user has added or a quick guide for new users.

> The site fetching is driven by keywords the user defines per site along with the desired relevanct they've put on each keyword.

> Each site should show the total of previous matches along with the actual total of matches and then present the diff between them.

## 2. Layout Design
